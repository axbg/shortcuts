## Configure a cloudflared tunnel

### 1. Create a new tunnel
- Execute
    ```bash
    cloudflared tunnel create <tunnel-name>
    ```

### 2. Copy tunnel hash
- Execute
    ```bash
    cloudflared tunnel list
    ```

- Copy tunnel hash as `<tunnel-hash>`

### 3. Create a configuration file
- Create a config file as ~/.cloudflared/.config.yml

- Populate with the following content:
    ```bash
    url: http://localhost:8080 # the targeted local app
    tunnel: <tunnel-hash> (previously copied)
    credentials-file: /home/axbg/.cloudflared/<tunnel-hash>.json
    ```

### 4. Configure routing
- Execute
    ```bash
    cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel-name> <hostname>
    # hostname defined as subdomain.domain.com
    ```

### 5. Run the tunnel to test the configuration
- Execute
    ```bash
    cloudflared tunnel run <tunnel-name>
    ```

- Kill the command to close the tunnel

### 6. Run cloudflared as a service
- Copy config.yml, cert.pem and the tunnel json file in /etc/cloudflared

- Install cloudflared as a service:
    ```bash
    sudo cloudflared service install
    ```

### Additional operations
- To stop cloudflared, just stop the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop cloudflared
    ```

- If you want to remove the service in order to modify the existing tunnel: 
    1. Execute 
        ```bash
        sudo cloudflared service uninstall
        ```
    2. Delete the config files in /etc/cloudflared and copy the new ones
    3. Recreate the service
        ```bash
        sudo cloudflared service install
        ```
